This is a repository for bootstrapping a new http-server

This repo contains code for 
1. Creating a starter http server with a healthcheck and an example API
2. This server can directly be dockerised and/or hosted on a machine.

Follow the Makefile.

eg `make flask_server` will create a bootstrap http-server for python.
